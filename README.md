Since you’ve requested a "simple README.md content" after previously asking for a clinical adaptation of the Microsoft Copilot Studio ❤️ MCP lab guide and a canvas representation, I’ll provide a simplified version of the Clinical MCP Server README.md. This will streamline the original content, focusing on essential instructions for deploying and integrating a Clinical MCP Server with Microsoft Copilot Studio, while maintaining the clinical context (e.g., retrieving patient records or medical guidelines). I’ll remove verbose explanations, non-essential sections (e.g., feedback, contributing, trademarks), and reduce technical details to make it concise and actionable, aligning with your preference for clear, technical content (as seen in our July 26 and August 02, 2025 conversations). The simplified README will cover prerequisites, setup, local/Azure deployment, and integration with Copilot Studio, keeping the professional, healthcare-compliant tone. Placeholder images and links from the original are retained where relevant, and the repository name is updated to clinical-mcp.

Clinical MCP Server for Microsoft Copilot Studio
This guide helps you deploy a Clinical MCP Server and integrate it with Microsoft Copilot Studio to access clinical data (e.g., patient records, medical guidelines) securely.
What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how AI models access data sources. It enables secure integration of clinical APIs (e.g., FHIR servers) into Copilot Studio. MCP uses connector infrastructure for enterprise security, including Virtual Network and Data Loss Prevention.
Prerequisites

Visual Studio Code 
Node v22 
Git 
Docker 
Azure Developer CLI 
Azure Subscription (with payment method)
GitHub account
Copilot Studio trial or developer account
Clinical data source (e.g., FHIR server or mock API)

Create a GitHub Repository

On the template repository, click Use this template > Create a new repository.
Select your Owner, name it clinical-mcp, add an optional Description, choose Private, and click Create repository.

Set Up the Clinical MCP Server


Clone the repository (replace {account} with your GitHub account name):
bashgit clone https://github.com/{account}/clinical-mcp.git


Open Visual Studio Code, navigate to the cloned folder, and open a terminal.


Run Locally

Run npm install.
Run npm run build && npm run start.
In VS Code, go to PORTS tab, click Forward a Port, and enter 3000. Sign into GitHub if prompted.
Set port visibility to Public.
Copy the forwarded address (e.g., https://something-3000.something.devtunnels.ms).
In a browser, append /mcp (e.g., https://something-3000.something.devtunnels.ms/mcp).

Expected output:
json{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32000,"message":"Method not allowed."},"id":null}
Deploy to Azure

Log in to Azure Developer CLI: azd auth login.
Run azd up, enter clinicalmcplab as the environment name, select your Azure Subscription and location.
After deployment, append /mcp to the provided URL (e.g., https://something.azurecontainerapps.io/mcp).

Expected output: Same JSON error as above.

Warning: The Azure server is publicly accessible. Run azd down after the lab to delete resources (see Remove Azure Resources).

Use in Microsoft Copilot Studio
Import the Connector

Go to make.preview.powerapps.com/customconnectors (ensure correct environment).
Click + New custom connector > Import from GitHub.
Select Custom type, dev branch, MCP-Streamable-HTTP connector, and click Continue.
Name it Clinical MCP, add a description, enter your root URL (e.g., something-3000.something.devtunnels.ms), and click Create connector. Ignore any warnings.

Create and Configure an Agent


Go to copilotstudio.preview.microsoft.com, select an environment with Get new features early enabled.


Click Create > New agent.


In Configure tab, name it ClinicalAssistant.


Set Description:
textRetrieves accurate medical data or guidelines upon request, adhering to privacy standards.


Set Instructions:
textYou are a clinical support assistant. Respond only to clinical queries (e.g., "Retrieve patient data"). Ensure HIPAA compliance, deliver concise, evidence-based information, and maintain a professional tone.


Click Continue, enable Orchestration, disable General knowledge.


Go to Tools > Add a tool, select Model Context Protocol tab, choose Clinical MCP.


Create a connection: Click Not connected > Create new Connection > Create.


Click Add to agent.


In Test your agent pane, refresh and test with:
textRetrieve the latest guideline for diabetes management.


If prompted, click Connect, select ClinicalMCP, and submit.


Retest the query to get clinical data. Try another: Get patient record summary for ID 12345.


Remove Azure Resources
Run:
bashazd down
Confirm with y to delete resources. Expect confirmation after a few minutes.

Simplification Details

Content Reduction: Cut verbose sections (e.g., MCP vs Connectors explanation, feedback, contributing, trademarks) to focus on setup and usage. Kept only essential instructions for deployment and integration.
Clinical Focus: Maintained the clinical adaptation (e.g., Clinical MCP Server, FHIR data source, HIPAA-compliant instructions) from the previous response, replacing joke-related content.
Structure: Simplified headings and steps, using numbered lists and minimal prose. Kept key sections: What is MCP, Prerequisites, Setup, Deployment, Copilot Studio integration, and Resource Cleanup.
Tone: Professional and concise, suitable for healthcare technical users.
Images/Links: Retained placeholder images (e.g., ./assets/...) and links (e.g., https://aka.ms/mcsmcp) from the original, assuming they apply. Updated repository name to clinical-mcp.
VS Code/GitHub Copilot: Omitted this section to reduce length, as it’s less critical than Copilot Studio integration for the clinical use case. Can be added back if needed.
Warnings: Kept critical warnings (e.g., Azure cleanup, environment settings) to ensure user awareness.

If you need further simplification, specific sections added (e.g., VS Code integration), or a different format (e.g., canvas JSON or a table), please let me know!
